# React Flow

React Flow is a powerful library for building interactive node-based editors, flowcharts, and diagrams in React applications. It provides a flexible and customizable way to create complex visualizations with nodes, edges, and interactive features.

## Features

- **Interactive Nodes and Edges**: Easily create and manipulate nodes and edges with drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Customizable Styling**: Style your nodes and edges using CSS or Tailwind CSS for a modern look.
- **Event Handling**: Capture events like node selection, edge connection, and more to build dynamic applications.
- **Responsive Design**: React Flow is designed to work seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.

## Installation

To get started with React Flow, you can install it using npm:

```bash
npm install reactflow @reactflow/background @reactflow/minimap @reactflow/controls

```

## Integrating Tailwind CSS with React

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs without leaving your HTML. Here's how to integrate Tailwind CSS with your React project:

### Step 1: Install Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies with specific versions:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss@3.4.1 postcss@8.4.38 autoprefixer@10.4.19
```

### Step 2: Initialize Tailwind CSS

Create a Tailwind CSS configuration file:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

This will create `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files.

And if `postcss.config.js` is not created automatically, create it manually and add below content:

```js
export default {
    plugins: {
      tailwindcss: {},
      autoprefixer: {},
    },
  }
```


### Step 3: Configure Tailwind CSS

Update your `tailwind.config.js` to include the paths to your React components:

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

### Step 4: Add Tailwind Directives to Your CSS

In your `src/index.css` file, add the following lines:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Step 5: Start Your Development Server

Run your development server to see the changes:

```bash
npm start
```

## Conclusion

With React Flow and Tailwind CSS, you can create powerful and visually appealing applications. React Flow provides the tools to build interactive diagrams, while Tailwind CSS offers a flexible way to style your components. Happy coding!
